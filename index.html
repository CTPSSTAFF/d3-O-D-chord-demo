			<p>This interactive graphic shows origin / destination highway traffic flow patterns among the districts in 
			the Boston Region MPO.</p>
			<p>Select a district by mousing over the light-colored edge of the circle. Then mouse-over a link to see the number of daily highway trips between the selected district and another district. Thicker links mean more daily highway trips.</p>
			<p>Districts are linked only if there were at least 5,000 daily highway trips between them. If a district does not appear in the graphic, it is because there were fewer than 5,000 daily highway trips between it and any other district in 2012.</p>
